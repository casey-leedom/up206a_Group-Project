## Project Proposal

### Introduction
Having a safe and affordable home is a basic human need. Homes are the starting point from which all elements of life flow. Yet, access to housing is consistently elusive. Grassroots movements around the world are advocating for the right to housing and demanding that those rights be recognized. In Spain, grassroots justice groups are educating the public about the nature and necessity of safe and affordable housing. They protest, organize to keep people in their homes, and lobby for legal capacity to create a more just housing market. One way to understand these movements’ impact is to study what changes have come about as a result of the movement’s actions. So, for this project, we’ll look to understand: What are the material outcomes of recent housing justice movements?

### Why It Matters

From the 90s until the housing bust in 2007, real estate was booming in Spain. The Spanish housing market focused on building new houses and banks offered generous mortgages. Spanish families were burdened with incredible debt when the financial crisis hit. Unemployment rose, the economy tanked, and families were faced with either buying groceries or paying their mortgage or rent. Eviction filings skyrocked while houses around the country sat empty. 

Out of this crisis, came outcries from housing rights movements like DESC Observatory and PAH, which stands for Platform for Mortgage-affected People. These movements are fighting to keep people in their homes. They challenge the political and financial forces that insufficiently care for their communities. They assert that housing is a human right.
 
It is important to consider the effects of these movements in the fight for housing as a human right. Their successes and where they hit roadblocks provide valuable insights to other movements. New policies, new ways of educating public opinion, and new lawsuits are all helpful. They set new precedents and move the fight for justice forward.
 
The stakes for housing justice movements are high. People need homes. Any step toward realizing the right to housing for marginalized peoples provides more stability.  Access to affordable housing is especially important in the current moment with the COVID-19 pandemic. Sheltering in place is one of the primary tools to prevent the further spread of the virus, and the pandemic’s economic impact has put more tenants at risk of eviction.

### Spatial Scope
The project will look into the housing market conditions in Spain in the last 10 years, with particular attention on the Province with the greatest amount of evictions: Barcelona. Barcelona City Council put together a comprehensive housing plan for 2016-2025, which included strategies for paving a new path for housing in the city. The project will glance at the conditions that prompted this plan and see how those strategies have since influenced the market.

Data will be analyzed before and after the primary housing social movement in each case. The timeline will be specifically related to major events within the movement, as well as any significant housing policy that was implemented as a result of each movement. The timeline of data will differ for each case study, and will be chosen in order to represent the effects of the housing social movement. 

### Data Sources
We will analyze data related to each housing movement before and after policy implementation. This data will include a combination of housing vacancy profiles, owner-occupied / rental units, populations of unhoused people, housing costs, distribution of social housing, and rent-controlled units and their associated costs. The data for each city may differ slightly, as it will center around the specific policy implementation used in that city to address housing needs. 

The following data sources provide relevant housing data for Spain and Barcelona. While available data shows a general picture of the housing market, it does not cover the exact temporal and spatial breakdowns that we'd hope to show.

### Methodology 
Our intial methodology was to determine cities that have strong grassroots housing movements to research. We’ve modified our original project plan from comparing housing movements in two countries to a focus on housing in Spain based on the challenges we’ve faced in finding and translating data in each of these locations. Housing markets and policies are systematically different in each country, so by focusing on Barcelona (and Spain), we are able to dive into the historical and political background of housing justice issues specific to Spain. So, we will show the general housing conditions in Spain, then move to discuss the changes in Barcelona before and after their newest policy changes.

The methodology flow chart below shows our process, with completed steps shaded.

### Conclusion
Grassroot movements leverage their communities’ strengths and dreams to create power for themselves. While we know that the communities, context, and constitutional rights surrounding each movement differ, we intend to illuminate the change that can accompany action throught the housing justice movements in Spain. We are particularly interested in the ways that these actions change the public perception of the value of housing and how governing bodies change their housing practices. We hope that these insights - both the challenges and successes - will offer encouragement to other movements to continue the fight for housing for all.

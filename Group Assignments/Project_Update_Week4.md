# The Potential of Grassroots Housing Movements in Barcelona and Spain 
[See our Intitial Project Proposal Here](https://github.com/casey-leedom/up206a_Group-Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Project%20Proposal.md)

## Here's the latest on our project:

We’ve modified our original project plan from comparing housing movements in two countries to a focus on housing in Spain based on the challenges we’ve faced in finding and translating data in each of these locations. Housing markets and policies are systematically different in each country, so by focusing on Barcelona (and Spain), we are able to dive into the historical and political background of housing justice issues specific to Spain. 

We’re still solidifying what specific spatial elements beyond Barcelona to explore. We are certainly using Barcelona as the base, but will either explore Spain’s housing market more broadly or how Barcelona’s actions have spread to other cities in Spain. We hope to nail down our story and supporting data by February 8th. At that point, we will present our project narrative as part of our Midterm presentation. 

## How we plan to work together moving forward: 

We will largely be sharing responsibilities throughout the project and working together to create the project narrative, decide which graphics to produce and which data to analyze, and to work through coding issues to produce results. Here are preliminary “roles” for each team member:

**Tiffany: Senior Researcher, Coding Assistant, Expert on Barcelona**

**Casey: Senior Data Analyst, Research Assistant, Expert on Spain**
    
## An update on our data:

We have focused our data search on Barcelona, and will be looking to incorporate overall data for Spain in the next week. The data we've found is broken down by spatial elements, such as neighborhoods, districts, or municipalities, but it will need to be merged with geojson data in order to map the information for our project. We have found the following data sources:

**Barcelona housing data:**

[Housing Observatory of Barcelona](https://www.ohb.cat/#vis) 

[Barcelona City Hall Open Data](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset) 

[Barcelona City Hall geoJSON data (by municipalities, districts, barris)](https://github.com/martgnz/bcn-geodata) 

**Spain (overall) housing data:**

[Spain Population and Housing Census](https://www.ine.es/en/censos2011_datos/cen11_datos_resultados_en.htm#) 

## Concerns:

We have a few concerns about the project. Here's a quick list.

**Major concerns:**

* Will we find all the data we need?

**Medium concerns:**

* Are we repeating work that has already been done? How can we create a unique perspective on these housing issues and movements?

**Minor concerns:**

* Are we translating everything correctly?
* Will we be able to sufficiently learn about the history of housing in Spain in a ten-week timeframe?

### Week 7 Updates

We have a couple notebooks to show you this week. The first is a very clean notebook containing the Barcelona Rental Data from the midterm. In this notebook, you'll see functions and loops, and adjustments to the maps from the midterm (check out how the legend shows the same breakdowns for multiple maps instead of map-specific ones!). 

The second notebook brings in a new set of data - population data! This data was surprisingly hard to find (or not surprising considering our experience thus far!), so we used a breakdown of population by gender to find the total population by neighborhood. Complete with a function and for loop, we export a new file containing all data from 2011-2019 at the end. 

In other news: we've really nailed down our story. If you remember, we have struggled to find data for the right housing condition at the right size breakdown for the right years to really tell a good story of the before, during, and after of the housing movements' efforts in Spain. We have the most comprehensive data for housing conditions in Spain at the beginning of these movements. That's what we'll be showing: a snapshot of housing market scarcity as the housing justice movements began their work. This will include empty dwellings by neighborhood, tourist dwellings by neighborhood, Airbnb units in Barcelona, rental prices over the years, and evictions. We may also look at housing in poor condition.  

We have tossed around the idea of doing an additional pass at the data once the new census data becomes available next year.
